# Tasks Info

- Currently every 30 minutes there's a scan through all consultations to find those that are about to happen within 1h and 1h30min. For found consultations an email notification is sent immidiately, which means you won't be notified EXACTLY one hour before it starts, but somewhere between 1h-1h30min!
